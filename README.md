# IsingModel
This repository includes a module to simulate Monte Carlo Simulation of a 2D Grid of Spins interacting via an near neighbor Ising Hamiltonian. 
It allows to compute the statistical properties of the system such as magnetization, averagre energy per spin, magnetic susceptibility and 
specific heat of the system. 
By simply pulling the repository you should be able to execute the main.py file. This file contains different important parts of the
module: First the main class “IsingModel” is importet via “from IsingModel import IsingModel” and also external plotting functions via 
"from plotting import *". 
Executing the main.py file in it's default form you will simulate the system for tempreratures in ranges (1.0,4.0), save and plot all
statictical properties and correlation time graphs. Here we give some basic overwiev of a few most important functions and also explain
what other examples can be found in the main.py file.
